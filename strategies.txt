!!  Required input/parameters for the method
    Note: The performance can/should be maximised wrt these parameters
>>  Variants of the method


Evaluation of strategies:
-------------------------
Play against each other and record how frequently they win and which
opponent they fought.
>> Table of 1v1 scores (Asymmetric because A vs BBB may lead to different
   results than B vs AAA if there are positive/negative interactions
   between players using the same strategy. Do AA vs BB or useless?)
>> Elo rating system (repeat many plays against random opponent)
>> (basic) Same stategy for 4 players: how many turns to win on average


Trivial strategy:
-----------------
Always stop after one round.
Select any combination.


No risk strategy:
-----------------
Continue until all marker are placed. Note: because this is actually quite 
risky when many columns are filled, switch to 2 then 1 marker placed once a
certain number of columns are filled (+ distinguish importance of columns).
Select combination that require as few markers as possible.
!! Thumb rule to decide when to switch to trivial strategy.
>> Variant 1: After using few markers, do not make preferences (any)
>> Variant 2: After using few markers, prioritise more advanced columns
>> Variant 3: After using few markers, prioritise extreme columns
>> Variant 2: After using few markers, prioritise central columns

Score-threshold strategies:
---------------------------
Continue until a certain score is obtained.
Select combination that maximises the next score and require as few markers
as possible.
!! Need a score function to evaluate the current progression.
   Should be somehow based on expectancy of progression.
>> Variant 1: Prioritise the maximisation of the next score.
>> Variant 2: Prioritise the preservation of markers.


Score-expectancy strategies:
----------------------------
Continue until expectation of the next score is negative.
Select combination that maximises the expected score.
!! Need a score function to evaluate the current progression.
!! Need a way to evaluate expectancies
>> Ideal variant: Computation based on simulations of the next rounds.
>> Pragmatic variants: Thumb rules for expectancies.
